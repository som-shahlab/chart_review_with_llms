She has been in Rhode Island for \nsix months.  Her complaint is that she has heaviness in the chest.  She \ndoes not have any palpitations.  She does not note that this is \nassociated with exertion.  She does have diaphoresis associated with it.  \nShe does not have any shortness of breath.  This heaviness has been in \nher chest on and off for the last six weeks.  She is quite concerned.\n\nShe has a history of hypothyroidism and hypertension.  She also has \nhyperlipidemia and is being treated with Lipitor.  Her health \nmaintenance has been in order.  She has just had a hysterectomy.  She \nneeds to have a follow-up mammogram done.  However, today I am most \nconcerned about her chest heaviness.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her blood pressure is 130/80, respiratory rate is \n20 and pulse is 68.  Neck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  \nChest is clear to both percussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is \nregularly regular with no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and \nnontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of \ncyanosis, clubbing and edema.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Her sodium is 145, electrolytes are all otherwise \nwithin normal limits.  TSH is 2.0.  LFTs are pending at this time.  We \nsent her for an electrocardiogram, which showed normal sinus rhythm with \nnonspecific ST-T wave changes.  We also sent her for an exercise \ntolerance test with preliminary reports showing that she went to a \nmaximum heart rate of 108, she was on the protocol for 6 minutes 50 \nseconds.  She had no evidence of ischemia.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1.\tChest heaviness.  I am not sure what is causing this.  She may have a \nprimary pulmonary problem.  She will be following up with us in one \nweek.  It is heartening to see that she does not have an abnormal \nexercise tolerance test.\n2.\tHypothyroidism, well controlled at the present time.  Continue same \ndose of Synthroid.\n3.\tHypertension, well controlled presently.\n4.\tHyperlipidemia.  We will recheck this on her next visit.\n\nRE:  Russell, Donna\nMRN #:  10418061\nMay 12, 2079\nPage 2\n\nWe will also need to schedule a follow-up mammogram.\n\n_______________________________\nQuinn Rutledge, M.D.\n\nQR/QR5\n957307.doc\nDD:  \n05/25/2079\nDT:  05/27/2079\nDV:  05/12/2079\n    </Notes>\n    \n    <Task>\n    Please answer the User Query based on the notes in JSON format.\n    </Task>\n    \n    <Response>\n    "}]}
