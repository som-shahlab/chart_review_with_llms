She has had couple of further episodes of this peculiar \nsensation in which her arm feels like it goes dead and then she \ngets some pressure in her chest.  She gets a slight shortness of \nbreath.  It lasts 30 seconds.  She gets as many as three or four \na day.  The frequency has, however, decreased and she is feeling \nbetter and better, as she begins to lose some weight.  I think \nweight loss is going to be critical.  She also is less fatigued \nas she begins to lose weight.\n\nHer hypertension has been under better control.  \nHydrochlorothiazide seems to be helping quite a bit in addition \nto the atenolol.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure is 146/86.  Weight has gone \nfrom 200 to 196 pounds.  Respiratory rate is 20.  Pulse is 64.  \nNeck is supple.  There is no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to \npercussion and auscultation.  Cardiac exam is regularly regular \nwith no murmurs, gallops or rubs.  Abdomen is soft and nontender.  \nThere is no hepatosplenomegaly.  Extremities are clear of \ncyanosis, clubbing and edema.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  Electrolytes are within normal limits.\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN\n1.\tHypertension.  Relatively well controlled on \nhydrochlorothiazide plus atenolol.\n2.\tWeight.  Now began to lose some weight and feeling much \nbetter as a result of it.\n3.\tPeculiar chest pressure.  I do not think she has coronary \nartery disease given the exercise test.  In light of this, \nwe will try to control her blood pressure and get her to \nlose some weight.  Hopefully, this will help with the \nresolution of her symptoms.\n\n_______________________________\nQuinn Rutledge, M.D.\n\nQR/RM5\n855930.do\nc\nDD:  \n06/27/2079\nDT:  \n06/28/2079\nDV:  \n06/23/2079\n    </Notes>\n    \n    <Task>\n    Please answer the User Query based on the notes in JSON format.\n    </Task>\n    \n    <Response>\n    "}]}
