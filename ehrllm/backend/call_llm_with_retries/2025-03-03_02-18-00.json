She is tired of \"fighting\" her end stage \\nliver disease and does not feel that she has a good quality of \\nlife. She wished to meet with a representative from hospice, \\nwhich we were able to arrange, and she decided that she would \\nlike to go home with hospice. A conversation was held with the \\npatient regarding code status. She noted that she would probably \\nbe DNR/DNI, but would like to discuss it with her son (HCP). \\nTherefore, at this time, she remains full code. We also \\ndiscussed the possibility of her getting a pleurex catheter \\nplaced because of her repeated paracenteses. She was discharged \\nto home with hospice on ___.\\n\\n# Decompensated HCV cirrhosis with ascites: The patient \\npresented with worsening ascites. Her pain was initially managed \\nwith tramadol and morphine. She underwent ___ paracentesis \\non ___ with removal of 3.5L and she received albumin. Studies \\non the fluid were negative, and she reported a significant \\nimprovement in her pain.\\n \\n# Hyperkalemia: During her hospitalization, it was noted that \\nshe had hyperkalemia 5.3 -> 5.9 -> 6.9 without EKG changes. \\nAfter treatment with calcium gluconate 2gm x2, insulin and D50 x \\n2, and kayexelate, her K downtrended to 5.4. Her K has been \\npersistently elevated in the past and should continue to be \\nmonitored.\\n\\n# Hepatic encephalopathy: The patient\\'s mental status was A+Ox3 \\non admission. She was continued on rifaximin and lactulose \\nin-house and at discharge.\\n\\nCHRONIC ISSUES\\n==============\\n\\n# Hyponatremia - The patient has a history of asymptomatic \\nhyponatremia. It is most likely hypervolemic hyponatremia \\nrelated to underlying liver disease as well as aldosterone axis \\ndysfunction related to liver disease. She remained asymptomatic \\nthrough her hospitalization. Because she was also started on \\n10mg of furosemide to help prevent fluid re-accumulation, she \\nwill require BMPs twice weekly in the outpatient setting.\\n\\n# HIV: Emtricitabine-Tenofovir (Truvada) and Raltegravir were \\ncontinued in-house and at discharge.  \\n\\n# COPD: fluticasone, tiotropium and albuterol were continued \\nin-house and at discharge.\\n\\nTRANSITIONAL ISSUES\\n===================\\n[ ] Follow-up peritoneal fluid culture\\n[ ] New/changed medications: Furosemide 10mg daily (new)\\n[ ] For hyperkalemia and hyponatremia, the patient should have \\nbiweekly BMPs (script written).

You \\nwere admitted because of worsening abdominal pain. It is likely \\nthat this pain was due to increasing fluid in the abdomen from \\nyour cirrhosis. After a paracentesis in which much of this fluid \\nwas removed, your pain improved significantly. You were noted to \\nhave a high potassium during your hospitalization, which came \\ndown with treatment but this should continue to be followed as \\nan outpatient. You also emphasized your desire to speak with a \\nrepresentative from hospice. Because of your repeated \\nparacenteses, we also discussed the possibility of a pleurex \\ncatheter placement. We arranged for you to meet with hospice \\ncoordinators, and you will be discharged home with hospice.\\n\\nWe wish you all the best!\\n\\nYour ___ care team\\n \\nFollowup Instructions:\\n___\\n'}\n    </Notes>\n    \n    <Task>\n    Please answer the User Query based on the notes in JSON format.\n    </Task>\n    \n    <Response>\n    "}]}
