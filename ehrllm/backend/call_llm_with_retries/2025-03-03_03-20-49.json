She has been exercising and has lost from \n200 to 170 pounds.  She is feeling very well.\n\nNotably, Dr. Lu sent her for a follow-up ETT.  He did not find the \nfirst ETT acceptable.  The second ETT was grossly positive.  As a result \nof this, I think it is reasonable for us in addition to having her on \natenolol to stop the hydrochlorothiazide, put her on ramipril and a \nnitrate.  She is having once every two weeks feeling a slight twinge of \npain that she was having before when she went up steps.\n\nShe did have hyperlipidemia.  We have put her on Lipitor, which has \nprovided some control.  However, her HCL is still 36 and LDL 118, which \nis not an excellent ratio.  Nonetheless, her CK has been within normal \nlimits.\n\nShe also has right shoulder lipoma.  This has become apparent since she \nlost so much weight.  She wanted to see someone in follow up and I have \nrecommended Dr. Dawson.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her weight is 170 pounds, blood pressure is \n120/64, respiratory rate is 20, and pulse is 64.  Neck is supple.  There \nis no lymphadenopathy.  Chest is clear to percussion and auscultation.  \nCardiac exam is regularly regular with no murmurs, gallops, or rubs.  \nAbdomen is soft and nontender.  There is no hepatosplenomegaly.  \nExtremities are clear of cyanosis, clubbing, and edema.\n\nLABORATORY DATA:  None today.\n\nRussell, Donna\n10418061\n08/11/79\nPage 2\n\nASSESSMENT AND PLAN:\n1.\tCAD.  We will start her on ramipril and long acting nitrate.  I also \ngave her nitroglycerine.  We will stop her hydrochlorothiazide but \ncontinue her atenolol.  She is also on one aspirin a day along with \nPremarin and Synthroid.\n2.\tWeight loss.  She will continue to exercise.  I suspect she is going \nto lose more weight.  This is excellent.\n3.\tCoronary artery disease.  Dr. Lu will be deciding when to do a \ncardiac catheterization.  It is his opinion, and I must concur that \nthis is an appropriate next step with Ms. Russell.  She is going to \ndelay her usual trip to Rhode Island until we can get final assessment \ndone on this variety of medical issues.\n\n_______________________________\nQuinn Rutledge, M.D.\n\nQR/RM5\n055626.doc\nDD:  \n08/16/2079\nDT:  08/18/2079\nDV:  08/11/2079\n    </Notes>\n    \n    <Task>\n    Please answer the User Query based on the notes in JSON format.\n    </Task>\n    \n    <Response>\n    "}]}
